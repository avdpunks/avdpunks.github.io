## Introduction

The current AVD Insights are based on Azure Log Analytics workspaces that use multiple agents such as Monitoring Dependency Agent or Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to collect monitoring data from session hosts. 

AVD Insights visualizes these AVD platform log entries, session hosts event logs and performance data in charts and tables. The idea behind it is to improve troubleshooting to solve problems faster and get a complete overview of the entire AVD environment. You can also create some report exports to discuss usage with the management level. 

Two years ago, on 19 August 2021, we announced we were retiring the Log Analytics Agent (MMA & Co) to simplify everything to one agent, the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA). Because of this, we need to move all virtual machines to Azure Monitor Agent by 31 August 2024, which includes Azure Virtual Desktop Session Hosts and AVD Insights.

Here is the [official announcement:](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/were-retiring-the-log-analytics-agent-in-azure-monitor-on-31-august-2024/)

*"On 31 August 2024, we'll retire the Log Analytics agent that you use in Azure Monitor.â€¯Before that date, you'll need to start using the Azure Monitor agent to monitor your VMs and servers in Azure."* 

With only one monitoring agent, we want to eliminate confusion about which agent is responsible for which mission.

This change also affects AVD insights, and we need to migrate existing AVD session hosts to use the Azure Monitor agent, and new session hosts we should enable to use the new agent directly. 

This blog post does not describe how to migrate from the legacy agent to the Azure Monitor agent, but how to enable AVD Insight with AMA. Please follow the [migrate guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration).

Here is the official announcement of the public preview for [AVD Insight powered by Azure Monitor Agent.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-azure-virtual-desktop-insights-powered-by-the-azure-monitor-agent/) 

## Understanding the Function of Azure Monitor Agent

Azure Monitor Agent serves as a bridge between AVD deployments and Azure Monitor, enabling administrators to gain real-time insights into the performance and health of their virtual desktop environments. By collecting essential telemetry data from AVD infrastructure and session hosts, the agent facilitates informed decision-making, proactive issue resolution, and overall optimization.

Azure Monitor Agent uses data collection rules that allow you to specify the specific data you want each agent to collect. These rules allow you to comprehensively manage data collection settings and create different, customized configurations for specific groups of machines. It is possible to specify rules that route data from numerous machines to multiple destinations across regions and tenants.

The following diagram shows the AVD Insights with Azure Monitor:

![This image shows Azure Monitor with AVD](/assets/img/2023-08-31/2023-08-31-100.png)

Related to AVD, Windows event logs, such as FSLogix logs, are captured from session hosts along with performance counters such as processor information, memory, or terminal services. Additionally, some information comes from the AVD platform itself, e.g. AVD Errors or NetworkData logs, which are sent to the Log Analytics Workspace.

If you want to understand the differences between Azure Monitor Agent and Legacy Agents, please follow this link: [Compare to legacy agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#compare-to-legacy-agents)

## Enabling AVD Insights (Preview) Using Azure Monitor Agent

### Requirements

AVD Insights (Preview) with Azure Monitor Agent has the same [requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/insights?tabs=analytics#prerequisites) as the previous version of AVD Insight, which means you need a Log Analytics Workspace to collect all log entries and performance counters.

//System Managed Identity 

You can use the following PowerShell commands to create a new Log Analytics workspace:
```
$ResourceGroup = "YourResourceGroupName"
$WorkspaceName = "YourLogAnalyticsWorkspaceName"
$Location = "YourRegion"
New-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -Location $Location -Name $WorkspaceName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup
```
Otherwise, you can follow the [Microsoft documentation to create Log Analytics workspace in the Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace?tabs=azure-portal).

### How to enable AVD Insight (Preview)

#### Via Azure Portal

1. Open Azure Virtual Desktop Blade [(https://azavd.cmd.ms/)](https://azavd.cmd.ms/) and navigate to **Host Pools** and select the host pool you want to enable for AVD Insights with Azure Monior Agent.

2. Under **Monitoring**, select **Insights (Preview)**, which normally opens the AVD Insights, but if it is not yet configured, it shows that the configuration workbook is opened.

![This image shows the deallocation workflow](/assets/img/2023-08-31/2023-08-31-000.png)

3. Next, you will see that **Azure Monitor is not configured** and click **Open Configuration Workbook** to start the configuration.

![This image shows the deallocation workflow](/assets/img/2023-08-31/2023-08-31-001.png)

4. On the **Resource diagnostics Settings** tab, select your **Log Analytics workspace** where you want to store all logs. 

>**Note:** When setting the Log Analytics workspace, it may be helpful to click **Refresh** in the workbook.

After that, you need to **configure the host pool and workspace** to send the log from the AVD platform to your Log Analytics workspace. These configuration steps are quite simple and are the same as in the old version of AVD Insights. The diagnostic settings are provided in your Host Pool and Workspace, which configures the destination for all data.

5. Switch to the **Session Host Data Settings** tab and the next steps are now new. First of all we need to create a resource group, which has a fixed default name **AzureMonitor-DataCollectionRules** for now and can be customized in the future. 

Click **Create Resource Group** to create this special resource group for AVD Insights.

![This image shows the deallocation workflow](/assets/img/2023-08-31/2023-08-31-003.png)

6. You must confirm the creation of the resource group again and click **Create Resource Group**.
