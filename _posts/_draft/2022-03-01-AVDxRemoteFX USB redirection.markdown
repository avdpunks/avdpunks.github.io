## Introduction
What is a Cloud Engineering Workspace without the loved engineering pheripherie device, the 3DS Spacemouse? In this post we cover all essentials around the RemoteFX USB redirection in an Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) or Remote Desktop environement and how to configure it.

*Note: Ofcorse this applies to other USB devices too.* üòä

## Device redirection overview
AVD and the RDP allow us to use specific types of devices effectively in a remote session, e.g.:
- Easy Print, which allows users to print to local printers in remote sessions
- Drive Redirection, which allows users to access the file system on any local drive in a remote session, including USB drives
- Smart Card Redirection, which allows users to authenticate to and in a remote session by using smart cards/e-tokens
- Plug-and-Play Device Redirection, which allows users to access PTP digital cameras, MTP music players, and POS for .NET devices in a remote session, among others
- Input Redirection, which allows the use of keyboards/mice in remote sessions
- Audio Redirection, which allows recording and playback of audio in remote sessions
- Port Redirection, which allows the use of serial and parallel ports in remote sessions

These high-level redirections can be controlled and resitricted via the [RDP Properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/rdp-files) directly from the portal. [Patrick Koehler](https://avdlogix.com/wvd-rdp-properties-explained) covered this in a very comprehensive post. *Thanks Patrick*

However, there are many devices like the spacemouse, printers webcams, scanners and more which are not covered by this redirections.
RemoteFX USB redirection enables you to redirect these devices and brings you the best of both worlds and an improved user experience.
*Note* RemoteFX USB redirection compliments your high-level redirection and doesn't replace them.

Here is a table that compares and contrasts the two forms of redirection.

## Device redirections compared
| RemoteFX USB Redirection | RDP High-Level Device Redirection |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| No drivers are required on the client machine | Driver installation is required on the client machine |
| One redirection method regardless of device type | Specific redirection methods based on the device type
 |
| Forwards URBs to/from the device via RDP connection | Exposes high-level device functionality within remote sessions via optimized protocols based on the device type |
| Devices can only be used during one RDP session at a time (i.e: another client machine cannot use the USB device while it‚Äôs in use during another remote session) | Multiple remote desktop sessions can access and control a device simultaneously (this includes the local client, too) |
| RemoteFX is optimized for Local Area Networks (LAN) | RDP high-level device redirection functions on both WAN and LAN networks |

## What is RemoteFX?
RemoteFX was invented and developed by Calista Technologies and quickly acquired by Microsoft in 2008. 

It  was released in 2011 as part of Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows. 
It was designed to deliver a rich user experience and graphic hardware support to Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs).
Over the last 9+ years, RemoteFX improved the overall user experience during a remote desktop session and let users enjoy high-quality media support, audio-synchronization, graphics, and RemoteFX USB redirection.

With new features like Adaptive Graphics, RemoteFX Multi-Touch, RemoteFX Media Redirection, and RemoteFX for WAN the RDP Protocol and experience improved massivley. 

With Windows Server 2012, and subsequent releases including RemoteFX in Windows 10, RemoteFX was designed with more default features that made it simpler and easier to use.

## Requirement

Some general requirements were
The host machine‚Äôs Hyper-V server needs a ‚Äúnon-server core setup‚Äù that excludes any media codecs before connecting RemoteFX with a vGPU (virtual graphical processing unit).

No additional configuration is necessary to enable RemoteFX Media Streaming (or any other RDP service).

When users meld RemoteFX USB redirection and RDP high-level device redirection, the best of both worlds can be achieved.

Other RemoteFX requirements are:

DirectX 11.0-compatible GPU alongside a WDDM 1.2-compatible driver (for those using Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1: server(s) need no less than one DirectX 9.0c and 10.0 compatible graphics card).
A CPU that supporting Second-Level Address Translation (SLAT).
Installed VM instances that run on (and are created with) Hyper-V.
Host computers with non-domain Controllers.
Enabled RemoteFX vGPU support for the below listed operating systems:
‚óã Windows 7 SP1
‚óã Windows 8.1
‚óã Windows 10 1703 or newer
‚óã Windows Server 2016 (in single-session deployment only)
Even though GPUs with OpenGL/OpenCL is supported and provide full-functionality, it is strongly advised to only use graphics cards designed to work within a professional workstation.

## Enable RemoteFX on your AVD session hosts
1. Open run with **Windows + R** and enter **gpedit.msc**. Open the "Local Group Policy Editor".

2. From the navigation tree on the left, select: **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Device and Resource Redirection**. Open **Do not allow supported Plug and Play device redirection** and select **Allow plug&play device redirection**

3. Choose the **Disabled** option and click **OK** in the pop-up window as shown below.disabled do not allow plug and play device redirection

4. **Restart** your session host to apply the changes

## Enable RemoteFX USB redirection in Windows 10/Windows 11
The RemoteFX USB redirection feature is disabled by default so lets enable it. 

1. On your client run **gpedit.msc**.

2. Open: **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Connection Client\RemoteFX USB Redirection**.

![2022-03-01-001.png](/assets/img/2022-03-01/2022-03-01-001.png)

3. Set **Allow RDP redirection of other supported RemoteFX USB devices from this computer** to **Enabled** and specify which users have RemoteFX USB device redirection permission. Click **OK** and finish the configuration.

4. Finally run ‚Äúgpupdate /force‚Äù to update the machine‚Äôs policy.

Note: Ofcorse you can use the Group Policy Management to configure this settings via Active Directory Group Policies üòä.
After creating and configuring a new policy, link the policy to the Organizational Unit of the target machine‚Äôs location.

OR you use Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (#MEM) to configure this settings.

Lastly, connect you non Plug & Play device to your PC and start your AVD session! üí°

## Conclusion ##
acts as a catch-all mechanism that redirects these USB devices! Unlike high-level redirections such as drive redirection, RemoteFX USB redirection happens at the port protocol (USB request block or URB) level, and is similar to how one can redirect serial or parallel ports via RDP. This provides some unique advantages, as you‚Äôll see below. However, RemoteFX USB redirection is meant to supplement high-level redirections, not to supplant them. By combining RemoteFX USB redirection with RDP high-level device redirections, you can have the best of both worlds.
