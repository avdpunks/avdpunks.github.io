How to Enable the Windows Insider Preview Build
Are you interested in getting early access to new features and updates for Windows? If so, you might want to consider joining the Windows Insider Program. This program allows you to preview builds of the upcoming release of Windows and provide feedback to help shape the future of the operating system.
Here’s how to enable the Windows Insider Preview Build:
Open the Settings app on your Windows 11  PC and navigate to the “Windows Updates” section.
Click on the “Windows Insider Program” tab on the left side of the screen.
Click on the “Get started” button.
Follow the prompts to link your Microsoft account and choose your Insider settings. You can choose between the “Dev Channel” (for the earliest access to new features), the “Beta Channel” (for slightly more stable builds), or the “Release Preview Channel” (for the most stable preview builds).
Once you’ve chosen your settings, your PC will begin downloading the latest Insider Preview Build. This may take some time, depending on your internet connection.
After the download is complete, you’ll need to restart your PC to install the new build.
That’s it! You’re now part of the Windows Insider Program and will receive regular updates with new features and improvements. Remember to provide feedback to help shape the future of Windows.
Note: Keep in mind that Insider Preview Builds may be less stable than regular releases and could potentially cause issues with your PC. Make sure to back up your important data before joining the program.
