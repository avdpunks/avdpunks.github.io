## Introduction
Traveling across europe with my Van while working on a VDI deployed in Western Europe can be a challenge, especially when route planning. üòÖ

And so you might have the same or at least the challenge that a lot of your deployments are in the North/West Europe Region or anywhere, but not in the same country your end users are located in. 

This brings the big question, can we improve the over all user experience by redirecting the edge device location. 

Yes...and No. Windows is determining the location and region settings based on multiple factors and some services services (like your search engine of choice) are using the IP-based Geo-location to display results. The only way at the moment to improve this, is via a proxy in the country itself. 

Nevertheless, we notices new settings in the [Windows Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-device-redirections) and RDP Properties and managed to redirect the location to the session host. This allows us to get weather reporting, more relevant local news, and overall greater functionality for apps and Windows like the map. 

‚ö†Ô∏è There is no official documentation around this configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Lab setup and requirements

1. Windows 11 21H2 Edge Device
2. Windows MSRDC Client Version
3. Windows 11 21H2 Session Host, Intune joined since we are using the settings picker to configure the session host.

Redirecting geo-location information from the client device to remote desktops or published applications requires enabling the geo-location redirection feature on the session host machine, configuring group policy settings on your Active Directory server, and specifying which websites use this feature.

Location services must be enabled on both client devices and the session host. 

## Windows location service

All is about the famous **Windows location service**, which has been available since Windows 10. This service allows users to use their local location in websites and applications, e.g. for navigation requests or weather information. 

![This image shows the Edge location service](/assets/img/2022-06-14/2022-06-14-001.png)

>Microsoft location service will use a combination of global positioning service (GPS), nearby wireless access points, cell towers, and your IP address (or default location) to determine your device‚Äôs location.

Here you can find a detailed description about the [Windows location service and privacy.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-location-service-and-privacy-3a8eee0a-5b0b-dc07-eede-2a5ca1c49088)

## How to enable Location service on Windows 11 for AVD

There are several ways to enable the location service on Windows 11 devices, including Windows 11 multi-session. We will show all options from local settings to Intune configuration / GPOs to adding a registry key. 

Let's start with the local setting, which are not enterprise-grade because it is done manually. 

### Via local settings

From the start menu search for **Location** and open the **Privacy & security > Location** settings then you need to switch the Location services to **On**. Additionally, you can specify the location settings for individual application or service. 

![This image shows the Windows 11 Privacy & security:Location panel](/assets/img/2022-06-14/2022-06-14-003.png)

Please verify that the option **"Let desktop apps access your location"** is enabled that is needed for native AVD client.

### Via Intune Configuration Policy

The next option would be the ability to enable location services via the Intune configuration policy. We still focus on the **settings catalog** and not on the templates (ADMX, Custom & Co). 

The Settings Catalog is the only way to define configuration policies for Windows 10+ multisession (currently only System Settings). VDI is also supported with the settings catalog. It will be the next standard for configuration policies in the future. 

Please follow the description to create a new settings catalog for Windows 10+ VDI or multisession: [How to configure profiles](https://avdpunks.com/avd/2022/02/05/IntuneConfigOptForAVD.html#How-to-configure-profiles)

You can create a new configuration policy or add the setting to an existing policy. 

Search for **Allow Location** in the settings picker and select **Allow Location** in the results list. 

![This image shows the Intune Settings picker for Allow Location](/assets/img/2022-06-14/2022-06-14-005.png)

Next, select **Force Location On. All location privacy settings are toggled...** for the Allow Location setting on the Configuration Settings tab.

If you have created a new policy, you must assign that policy to a user or device group. 

That is all to enable location services via Intune configuration policy.

### Via GPO

Next, would be to define the Group Policy Setting for enable the Loaction services. Open your Group Policy editor and navigate to the following path:

```
# Computer configuration
Computer configuration > Administrative templates > Windows components > Location and sensors > Turn off location

# User configuration
User configuration > Administrative templates > Windows components > Location and sensors > Turn off location
```
> You must disable this setting to enable location services.

### Via Registry Key

Another option is to add the following registry to the session host and to your local machine to enable location services:

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\location]
"Value"="Allow"
```
## How to enable Location redirection for AVD

To redirect the client location, navigate to Azure Virtual Desktop, select your Hostpool, RDP Properties and add **redirectlocation:i:1** to your existing RDP properties in the advanced tab:

```
redirectlocation:i:1
```

![This image shows the Azure Portal RDP Properties](/assets/img/2022-06-14/2022-06-14-008.png)

Or you can enable the location redirection from the **Device redirection** tab and select **Enable location sharing from the local device and redirect to apps in the remote session** and click on **Save**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a host pool configuration and cannot be set individually per session host. 

This is how to enable location redirection on AVD session host. 

Let's see how it looks and feels.

## Conclusion

Even if it just a limited scope, it is an improvement for the overall user experience and since a couple of days the Azure Portal is showing new features in the RDP Properties section. So stay tuned for more updates.
