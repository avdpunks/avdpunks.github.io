*Based on RAND Corporation Research Report RRA2680-1*

Artificial Intelligence promises transformative results, yet by some estimates, **more than 80 percent of AI projects fail** — twice the rate of failure for IT projects that do not involve AI. RAND Corporation researchers interviewed 65 data scientists and engineers with at least five years of experience to uncover why.

Here are the **five leading root causes** of AI project failure:

## 1. Misunderstanding the Problem

Industry stakeholders often **misunderstand — or miscommunicate — what problem needs to be solved** using AI. When teams don't have clarity on the actual business problem, they build solutions that don't address real needs.

> Without a shared understanding of the problem, even the most sophisticated AI system will fail to deliver value.

## 2. Insufficient Training Data

Many AI projects fail because **the organization lacks the necessary data to adequately train an effective AI model**. Machine learning models are only as good as the data they learn from. Without sufficient quality data, models cannot learn the patterns needed to make accurate predictions.

## 3. Technology Over Problem-Solving

In some cases, AI projects fail because **the organization focuses more on using the latest and greatest technology than on solving real problems** for their intended users. The allure of cutting-edge tools can distract teams from the fundamental goal: delivering practical solutions.

## 4. Inadequate Infrastructure

Organizations might **not have adequate infrastructure to manage their data and deploy completed AI models**, which increases the likelihood of project failure. Even a well-trained model is useless if it cannot be effectively deployed and maintained in production environments.

## 5. Problems Too Difficult for AI

Sometimes, AI projects fail because **the technology is applied to problems that are too difficult for AI to solve**. Not every problem is a good fit for AI solutions. Some challenges require human judgment, lack sufficient data patterns, or involve too many unpredictable variables.

## The Bottom Line

Understanding these root causes is the first step toward building successful AI projects. Before embarking on your next AI initiative, honestly assess whether your organization:

- Has clearly defined and communicated the problem
- Possesses sufficient, high-quality training data
- Is focused on solving real problems (not just using new technology)
- Has the infrastructure to support AI deployment
- Is tackling a problem that AI can realistically solve
