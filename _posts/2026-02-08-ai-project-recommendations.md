*Based on RAND Corporation Research Report RRA2680-1*

With AI project failure rates exceeding 80%, organizations need actionable strategies to improve their odds of success. RAND Corporation researchers synthesized insights from 65 experienced data scientists and engineers to develop practical recommendations for both industry and academia.

## Recommendations for Industry Leaders

### 1. Ensure Technical Staff Understand the Project Purpose

**Misunderstandings and miscommunications about the intent and purpose of the project are the most common reasons for AI project failure.**

Bridge the gap between business stakeholders and technical teams. Invest time upfront to ensure everyone shares a common understanding of:
- The business problem being solved
- The domain context and constraints
- Success criteria and expected outcomes

### 2. Choose Enduring Problems

**AI projects require time and patience to complete.**

Before beginning any AI project, leaders should be prepared to commit each product team to solving a specific problem for **at least a year**. Quick wins are rare in AI — sustainable success comes from long-term commitment to important problems.

### 3. Focus on the Problem, Not the Technology

**Successful projects are laser-focused on the problem to be solved, not the technology used to solve it.**

Resist the temptation to adopt the latest AI trends. Instead:
- Start with a clear problem statement
- Select technology that fits the problem
- Measure success by problem resolution, not technical sophistication

### 4. Invest in Infrastructure

**Up-front investments in infrastructure can reduce the time required to complete AI projects and increase the volume of high-quality data available.**

Build robust infrastructure to support:
- **Data governance** — ensuring data quality, accessibility, and compliance
- **Model deployment** — enabling smooth transitions from development to production
- **MLOps practices** — maintaining models effectively over time

### 5. Understand AI's Limitations

**When considering a potential AI project, leaders need to include technical experts to assess the project's feasibility.**

Not every problem should be solved with AI. Before committing resources:
- Involve technical experts in early feasibility assessments
- Honestly evaluate whether AI is the right tool
- Consider alternative approaches when appropriate

## Quick Reference

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Miscommunication | Align technical and business teams on project purpose |
| Short-term thinking | Commit to problems for at least one year |
| Technology hype | Focus on solving real problems |
| Infrastructure gaps | Invest in data governance and deployment infrastructure |
| Overreach | Include technical experts in feasibility assessments |

## Start Today

The path to AI success isn't about having the most advanced algorithms — it's about having the right organizational practices, clear problem definitions, and realistic expectations. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can dramatically improve their AI project success rates.
