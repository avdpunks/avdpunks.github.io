RAND Corporation researchers interviewed 65 data scientists and engineers to find out why AI projects fail at twice the rate of other IT projects.

The #1 reason? **It's not the technology.**

**It's miscommunication.**

Teams often don't share a common understanding of what problem they're actually solving.

## The 5 Root Causes

Here are the 5 root causes they uncovered:

1. **Misunderstanding the problem** to be solved
2. **Lacking sufficient training data**
3. **Chasing shiny new tech** instead of solving real problems
4. **Inadequate infrastructure** for deployment
5. **Applying AI to problems** that are simply too hard for it

## The Good News

Each of these is preventable.

The researchers also developed actionable recommendations — like committing to problems for at least a year and investing in data infrastructure before diving into model development.

## Key Recommendations

- Ensure technical staff understand the project's business purpose
- Choose enduring problems worth long-term investment
- Focus on the problem, not the technology
- Invest in data governance and deployment infrastructure
- Include technical experts in feasibility assessments
